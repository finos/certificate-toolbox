# Certificate Toolbox
A collection of command-line tools to generate _*PKI Signing Certificates*_ and _*X.509 Identity Certificates*_ used to configure a Symphony Pod and generate Service Account (cert-based) credentials.

## How (cert-based) Service Account authentication works
A Service Account can interact with a Symphony Pod by using a set of API endpoints (ie `https://foundation-dev-api.symphony.com/*`), that must be configured (using Admin Console UI) to grant/deny access to the platform.

Using the Manage Certificates dashboard, you can import one or more "PKI signing certificates" (see how to generate it below)

When a Service Account wants to authenticate against the Agent API endpoint, it needs to provide an X.509 Identity Certificate (see how to generate it below); authentication is granted if:
- The Certificate Common Name (CN) starts with `CN=<Service Account Username>`
- The Certificate is signed with one of the "PKI signing certificates" configured on the Agent API endpoint

Read the [official Symphony documentation]() to know more about this topic.

## Generating certificates
Before moving forward, make sure you have [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) installed on your command-line; type `openssl` to verify.

If not installed, choose your preferred package system to install it, otherwise [check the openssl wiki third-party binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries)

### Generating a PKI (Root CA) Signing Certificate
Simply run the script and follow the instructions
```
$ ./create-root-ca-cert.sh
```

The generated PKI signing certificate can be found in `root/ca_signing_cert.pem` and is ready to be imported via the Symphony Pod Admin Console.

If you need to re-run the script, you must either
1. delete the `./root` folder (the scripts won't allow you to override them)
2. move (and backup) the `./root` folder and rerun the script; if you are interested to generate multiple Root CA Certificates, check how to configure OpenSSL default values (below)

### Generating a X.509 (User) Identity Certificate
Before starting, you must be aware that all User Certificates generated by the script are signed with the Root CA Certificate contained in the `./root` folder; as such, you must run `./create-root-ca-cert.sh` before running this script.

Simply run the script and follow the instructions
```
$ ./create-user-cert.sh <Service Account Username>
```

The generated X.509 Certificate can be found in `./users/<Service Account Username>.p12`.

#### The certs folder
The first time you run the `create-user-cert.sh` script, a `certs` folder is created in the project root, which contains:
- A `serial` file, defining an incremental ID to assign to User Certificates; the first one is `100000`
- a `certindex.txt` file, containing a summary of all the User Certificates generated (and their IDs)

Make sure you backup and keep this folder private.

## OpenSSL configuration
To speed things up when generating the certificates, you can change the OpenSSL default configurations that are prompted by each script; however, we advise you to keep the other configurations as they are, unless you know what you're doing.

### openssl-root-ca.ini

62: organizationalUnitName_default =
63: emailAddress_default =
64: localityName_default = NY
65: stateOrProvinceName_default = NY
66: countryName_default = US
```

### openssl-user.ini
